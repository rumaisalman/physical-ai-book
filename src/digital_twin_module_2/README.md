# Digital Twin Module 2

This package contains the code for the second module of the Physical AI Textbook, which is an introduction to the concept of digital twins. The module covers the basic concepts of digital twins, such as how to create a digital twin of a physical system and how to use it to simulate the behavior of the system. It also includes a simple example of a digital twin that subscribes to the `turtle1/cmd_vel` topic and publishes the same message to a new topic named `turtle2/cmd_vel`.
