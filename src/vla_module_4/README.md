# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module 4

This package contains the code for the fourth module of the Physical AI Textbook, which is an introduction to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. The module covers the basic concepts of VLA models, such as how to integrate visual perception with natural language understanding to generate actions for robotic systems or embodied AI agents. It also includes a simple example of a placeholder script for a VLA model.
