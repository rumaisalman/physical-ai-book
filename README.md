# Physical AI Textbook

This repository contains the source code for the Physical AI Textbook, a project dedicated to providing a comprehensive, hands-on guide to the field of physical artificial intelligence. The textbook is designed to be a living document, constantly updated with the latest research and developments in the field.

The project is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of physical AI. The modules are designed to be self-contained, allowing readers to pick and choose the topics that are most relevant to their interests.

The textbook is written in a combination of Markdown and Python, with the code examples provided as Jupyter notebooks. The project uses a variety of open-source tools and libraries, including ROS2, Isaac Sim, and PyTorch.
